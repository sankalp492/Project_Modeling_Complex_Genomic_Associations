# Project_Modeling_Complex_Genomic_Associations

1.Project Overview:

This project focuses on binary classification tasks (case/control) in a variety of simulated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Each dataset is designed to reflect different types of complex genetic associations, including:

Multivariate Additive Effects
Epistatic Interactions
Genetic Heterogeneity
Through data preparation, feature selection, and machine learning modeling, I was able to detect these associations and develop strategies to distinguish between predictive and non-predictive features in the datasets.

2.Objectives:

ðŸ”¹ Apply machine learning models to detect complex genetic associations.
ðŸ”¹ Use feature selection techniques to identify important SNPs.
ðŸ”¹ Investigate different preprocessing strategies for better model performance.
ðŸ”¹ Explore how different classification algorithms handle genetic heterogeneity.

3.Dataset Description:

Each dataset (2-wayEpi_100feat.txt, 2Additive_2-wayEpi_100feat.txt, 4-wayAdditive_100feat.txt, 4-wayHeterogeneous_100feat.txt) contains SNP features and a binary outcome (case/control).
The datasets represent different types of genetic interactions.
Users can experiment with feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and model tuning.

4.How to Use This Repository:
Prepare the Data
The datasets are located in the data/Small_Datasets directory.
Each dataset has different feature distributions and association structures.

5.Run the Analysis:
The analysis code is available in the Code directory and can be executed in either Python or a Jupyter Notebook. Users can customize the pipeline to experiment with different machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques to optimize model performance.
