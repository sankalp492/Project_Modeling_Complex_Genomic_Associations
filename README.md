# Project_Modeling_Complex_Genomic_Associations
This project deals with binary classification tasks (case/control) in a variety of simulated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Each dataset has a diﬀerent form of underlying complex association (e.g. mul�variate additive, epistatic, or genetic heterogeneity)
