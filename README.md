# Project_Modeling_Complex_Genomic_Associations
This project deals with binary classifica�on tasks (case/control) in a variety of simulated single nucleo�de polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Each dataset has a diﬀerent form of underlying complex associa�on (e.g. mul�variate addi�ve, epista�c, or gene�c heterogeneity)
